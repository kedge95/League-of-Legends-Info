I am currently having trouble figuring out the relationship between React Router, and Github pages. I initially used BroswerRouter when I made the project, and since uploading to pages have switched to HashRouter, but unfortunately still have problems on the initial load of the page. 

Clicking the League of Legends icon at the top-center of the screen will direct you to what should initially load, and clicking on Champions to the right of that icon will take you to a comprehensive list of all League of Legends champions accompanied by their respective default skins. Clicking on any champion will take you to a detailed page for that champion with their lore and abilities displayed below a full art image of the champion.
